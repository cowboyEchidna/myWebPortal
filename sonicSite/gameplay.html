		<h2>Sonic Mania</h2>
		<h3><blockquote>Gameplay</blockquote></h3>
		
		<p>Emulating the style of the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for the Sega Mega Drive, Sonic Mania is a 2D sprite-based side-scrolling platform game with Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles "Tails" Prower and Knuckles the Echidna as playable characters. The game uses an autosave feature that saves the player's progress at certain points.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The main playthrough of the game takes place in "Mania Mode", upon which a playable character is selected. The goal is to race to the end of each Act of in a series of Zones (a level in the game) in less than ten minutes. The game's levels consist of remixed Zones from past games, such as Green Hill Zone from the original Sonic the Hedgehog, and new Zones as well. The Zones have multiple routes to the goal and secret locations to be discovered by the player. There are also alternate routes that only certain playable characters can reach. Certain characters may also have certain unique aspects about their stories, such as the first Act of Green Hill Zone, which starts on a different path if the player is playing as Knuckles.</p>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<p>In gameplay, the series' collectible Rings can be found everywhere. Like in previous games, they act as health for the playable characters: as long as the player holds at least one, they will be protected from damage. Touching Badniks or obstacles like spikes inflicts damage. If the playable character gets damaged, they will drop all their Rings, though some can be recollected before they disappear. Taking damage without any Rings will cost the player a try. They will also lose a try if they spend too long underwater without replenishing their air supply or fall into a bottomless pit. Losing a try makes the player start from the last Star Post they passed in an Act, or from the beginning of the Act if they have not passed any Star Posts. Running out of tries will result in a Game Over; the player can continue if they earn a Continue, however.</p>
		<br>
		<p>All playable characters have the standard Spin Jump, Spin Attack and Spin Dash moveset. There are also unique maneuvers for each character; Sonic is able to use the Drop Dash, a new move introduced in this game, which allows the player to instantly dash into a Spin Dash upon landing from a jump; Tails can fly and swim; and Knuckles can glide and climb walls. Like in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, there is also a mode where the player can choose a second playable character to follow the lead character. One such mode for example allows Tails to follow Sonic and provide local cooperative play between two players, with Player 1 controlling Sonic and Player 2 controlling Tails. If Tails takes damage, he will not lose Rings. Tails can also fly while holding Sonic. With this, the player can reach areas that are hard for Sonic to reach on his own.</p>
