		<p>Sonic Mania is a side-scrolling platformer video game in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise which acts as a celebration of the Sonic series' 25th anniversary. Set in an alternate reality, the game follows Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles "Tails" Prower, and Knuckles the Echidna as they try to keep Dr. Eggman and his Hard Boiled Heavies from harnessing a mysterious new energy source. The storyline of the game also ties into the events of Sonic Forces.</p>

		<p>Sonic Mania was developed by Christian Whitehead, who had previously worked on enhanced ports of early Sonic games, with the aid of Headcannon and PagodaWest Games, who were chosen for their work in the Sonic fangame community; and was published by Sega. The game emulates the gameplay and 2D sprite animation of the original Sega Mega Drive Sonic games. The game was announced on 22 July 2016 and released digitally on 15 August 2017 for Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4, and on 29 August 2017 for PC. The game saw a physical release for Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 on 5 November 2019. A definitive version of the game, titled Sonic Mania Plus, was released on 17 July 2018. Downloadable content to the base game, titled "Encore DLC", was released alongside the physical version. Sonic Mania Plus includes the return of Mighty the Armadillo and Ray the Flying Squirrel as playable characters, as well as a 4-player Competition Mode and "Encore Mode".</p>
