		<h2>Sonic Mania</h2>
		<h3><blockquote>Bonus Levels</blockquote></h3>
		
		<p>nto the Star Circle that appears over Star Posts when said gimmicks are passed while carrying at least twenty-five Rings. Bonus Stages in Sonic Mania play like the Special Stages from Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic &amp; Knuckles, as well as the secret "Blue Sphere" bonus game that could be played by connecting a Sonic the Hedgehog cartridge to Sonic &amp; Knuckles. </p>
		<p>Here, the player must run across a spherical planet. To succeed, the player must collect blue spheres (and Rings as a bonus) whilst avoiding the red spheres (with the blue spheres turning into red spheres when collected; boxing a group of blue spheres inside a perimeter of red spheres will turn all the spheres in the box into Rings).</p>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<p>Collecting all Rings on the board will result in a "Perfect" score and the stage will end either when the player hits a red sphere or collects every blue sphere. The longer the player stays in the stage, the more it will speed up, thus increasing the difficulty.</p>
		<p>Two types of Medallions are awarded upon the completion of a Bonus Stage. Silver Medallions are awarded to those who only collects all the Blue Spheres, while Gold Medallions are awarded to those who collects all the blue spheres and Rings.</p>
